\myHeader

These exercises are taken mainly from the book ``\emph{Learning Concurrent Programming in Scala}'', and are designed to test the knowledge of the Scala programming language. 
%
You are required to implement higher-level concurrency abstractions in terms of basic JVM concurrency primitives.
The exercises are not ordered in any particular order, but some assume earlier exercises have been done.

% In the following set of exercises, you are required to implement higher-level concurrency abstractions in terms of basic JVM concurrency primitives. Some of these exercises introduce concurrent counterparts of sequential programming abstractions, and, in doing so, highlight important differences between sequential and concurrent programming. The exercises are not ordered in any particular order, but some of them rely on specific content from earlier exercises or this chapter:

% blindly copied:

\begin{myExercise}Implement a parallel method, which takes two computation blocks,~\code{a} and~\code{b}, and starts each of them in a new thread. The method must return a tuple with the result values of both the computations. It should have the following signature:
\begin{lstlisting}
def parallel[A, B](a: =>A, b: =>B): (A, B)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{myExercise}

\begin{myExercise}Implement a periodically method, which takes a time interval duration specified in milliseconds, and a computation block \code{b}. The method starts a thread that executes the computation block~\code{b} every duration milliseconds. It should have the following signature:
\begin{lstlisting}
def periodically(duration: Long)(b: =>Unit): Unit
\end{lstlisting}
\end{myExercise}

\begin{myExercise}Implement a \code{SyncVar} class with the following interface:
\begin{lstlisting}
class SyncVar[T] {
  def get(): T = ???
  def put(x: T): Unit = ???
}
\end{lstlisting}
A \code{SyncVar} object is used to exchange values between two or more threads.
When created, the \code{SyncVar} object is empty: Calling get throws an exception
Calling \code{put} adds a value to the \code{SyncVar} object
After a value is added to a \code{SyncVar} object, we say that it is non-empty:
Calling \code{get} returns the current value, and changes the state to empty Calling put throws an exception

\end{myExercise}

\begin{myExercise}The \code{SyncVar} object from the previous exercise can be cumbersome to use, due to exceptions when the \code{SyncVar} object is in an invalid state. Implement a pair of methods, isEmpty and nonEmpty, on the \code{SyncVar} object. Then, implement a producer thread that transfers a range of numbers 0 until 15 to the consumer thread that prints them.
\end{myExercise}

\begin{myExercise}Using the isEmpty and nonEmpty pair of methods from the previous exercise requires busy-waiting. Add the following methods to the \code{SyncVar} class:
\begin{lstlisting}
def getWait(): T
def putWait(x: T): Unit
\end{lstlisting}
These methods have similar semantics as before, but go into the waiting state instead of throwing an exception, and return once the \code{SyncVar} object is empty or non-empty, respectively.
\end{myExercise}

\begin{myExercise}A \code{SyncVar} object can hold at most one value at a time. Implement a \code{SyncQueue} class, which has the same interface as the \code{SyncVar} class, but can hold at most \code{n} values. The \code{n} parameter is specified in the constructor of the \code{SyncQueue} class.
\end{myExercise}

\begin{myExercise}The send method in the Deadlocks slides was used to transfer money between the two accounts. The \code{sendAll} method takes a set accounts of bank accounts and a target bank account, and transfers all the money from every account in accounts to the target bank account. The \code{sendAll} method has the following signature:
\begin{lstlisting}
def sendAll(accounts: Set[Account], target: Account): Unit
\end{lstlisting}
Implement the \code{sendAll} method and ensure that a deadlock cannot occur.
\end{myExercise}

\begin{myExercise}Recall the asynchronous method from the Guarded blocks slides. This method stores the tasks in a First In First Out (FIFO) queue; before a submitted task is executed, all the previously submitted tasks need to be executed. In some cases, we want to assign priorities to tasks so that a high-priority task can execute as soon as it is submitted to the task pool. Implement a \code{PriorityTaskPool} class that has the asynchronous method with the following signature:
\begin{lstlisting}
def asynchronous(priority: Int)(task: =>Unit): Unit
\end{lstlisting}
A single worker thread picks tasks submitted to the pool and executes them. Whenever the worker thread picks a new task from the pool for execution, that task must have the highest priority in the pool.
\end{myExercise}

\begin{myExercise}Extend the \code{PriorityTaskPool} class from the previous exercise so that it supports any number of worker threads \code{p}. The parameter \code{p} is specified in the constructor of the \code{PriorityTaskPool} class.
\end{myExercise}

\begin{myExercise}Extend the \code{PriorityTaskPool} class from the previous exercise so that it supports the shutdown method:
\begin{lstlisting}
def shutdown(): Unit
\end{lstlisting}
When the shutdown method is called, all the tasks with the priorities greater than important must be completed, and the rest of the tasks must be discarded. The important integer parameter is specified in the constructor of the \code{PriorityTaskPool} class.
\end{myExercise}

\begin{myExercise}Implement a \code{ConcurrentBiMap} collection, which is a concurrent bidirectional map. The invariant is that every key is mapped to exactly one value, and vice versa. Operations must be atomic. The concurrent bidirectional map has the following interface:
\begin{lstlisting}
class ConcurrentBiMap[K, V] {
  def put(k: K, v: V): Option[(K, V)
  def removeKey(k: K): Option[V]
  def removeValue(v: V): Option[K]
  def getValue(k: K): Option[V]
  def getKey(v: V): Option[K]
  def size: Int
  def iterator: Iterator[(K, V)]
}
\end{lstlisting}
Make sure that your implementation prevents deadlocks from occurring in the map.
\end{myExercise}

\begin{myExercise}Add a replace method to the concurrent bidirectional map from the previous exercise. The method should atomically replace a key-value pair with another key-value pair:
\begin{lstlisting}
def replace(k1: K, v1: V, k2: K, v2: V): Unit
\end{lstlisting}
\end{myExercise}

\begin{myExercise}Test the implementation of the concurrent bidirectional map from the earlier exercise by creating a test in which several threads concurrently insert millions of key-value pairs into the map. When all of them complete, another batch of threads must concurrently invert the entries in the map -- for any key-value pair \code{(k1, k2)}, the thread should replace it with a key-value pair \code{(k2, k1)}.
\end{myExercise}

\begin{myExercise}Implement a cache method, which converts any function into a memoized version of itself. The first time that the resulting function is called for any argument, it is called in the same way as the original function. However, the result is memoized, and subsequently invoking the resulting function with the same arguments must return the previously returned value:
\begin{lstlisting}
def cache[K, V](f: K => V): K => V
\end{lstlisting}
Make sure that your implementation works correctly when the resulting function is called   simultaneously from multiple threads.
\end{myExercise}
