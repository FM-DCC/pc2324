# title: Concurrent Programming 23/24 (CC3037)
---

The goal of this course is to introduce students to the fundamental theoretic and practical principals of concurrency, with emphasis on the correctness, design and implementation of models of concurrent computation using shared memory architectures.

 - __The 1st part__ of the course is more fundamental and is given by Nelma Moreira. More information [here](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~nam/Teaching/progcon2324/index.php).
 - __This 2nd part__ of the course will focus on the programming aspect, using the Scala language to study several concurrency patterns and libraries in Java Virtual Machines.
 - __Summaries__ and __assignments__ are placed in the associated [Moodle website](https://moodle2324.up.pt/course/view.php?id=1748).
- The __official plan__ of this course is hosted in FCUP [here](https://sigarra.up.pt/fcup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=445522).

# Teaching methods and learning activities

Lectures; intermediate test (mandatory) and final test  or final exam.

The lectures mix the presentation of new material (introducing concepts, main algorithms and some results) with interactive discussion of their application when solving real problems.

The homework focus is on practical application of algorithmic concepts, consolidating the learned material. 

The final exam and intermediate tests (closed book), globally evaluates the knowledge acquired by the students.


# Evaluation Type

Distributed evaluation with final exam

### Assessment Components

|designation | Weight (%)|
|------------|-----------|
|Exam |60,00|
|Assignment | 40,00|


### Amount of time allocated to each course unit

|designation | Time (hours)|
|------------|-------------|
|Home study | 56,00|
|Attendance time | 56,00|
|Assignment | 56,00|
|**Total:** | 162,00|


# Eligibility for exams

Students must attend at least 75% of the practical classes to be admitted to the exams.


# Calculation formula of final grade

Distributed evaluation will include both modelling (EM) and program implementation (EI). The final grade (FG) is obtained by weighting the distributed assessment scores and final exam (FE) as follows:

 - __FG__ = 4 * EM + 4 * EI + 12 * FE.
